### Project Architecture

The Onion Architecture was created [by Jeffrey Palermo in 2008](https://jeffreypalermo.com/2008/07/the-onion-architecture-part-1/) and this project is based in this architectural pattern.

### Build and Test
How to build, explore and test application

#### Emulator
Use the **Azure Cosmos DB Emulator** for local development and testing.  You can download and install the Azure Cosmos Emulator from the [Microsoft Download Center](https://aka.ms/cosmosdb-emulator)

#### Build
Run **Cosmos.Toggles.Ui.Api.csproj** and explore the swagger to exemplify all application flow. Execute command in the *cosmos-toggles/src* project path:
```powershell
dotnet run --project ./Ui/Cosmos.Toggles.Ui.Api/Cosmos.Toggles.Ui.Api.csproj
```

#### Test
Download the [free Postman app to get started](https://www.postman.com/downloads/)

>Postman is a collaboration platform for API development. Postman's features simplify each step of building an API and streamline collaboration so you can create better APIsâ€”faster.).

Open Postman and import Cosmos Toggles Collection from link:
```powershell
https://www.getpostman.com/collections/80a0e2627584345149ed
```

Run Postmand collection.
